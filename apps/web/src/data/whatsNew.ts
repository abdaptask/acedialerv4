      { type: 'fixed', text: 'Automatic SMS history import now correctly recognizes Telnyx\'s actual column names — earlier the import would silently fail for messages even when data existed.' },
      { type: 'improved', text: 'Migration backfill now tries multiple Telnyx API endpoint paths before giving up, so it works on every account regardless of Telnyx\'s URL conventions.' },

    version: '0.10.28',
    date: 'June 1, 2026',

    changes: [
      { type: 'new', text: 'When you migrate a user from the old dialer to ACE, their last 30 days of call logs AND SMS history automatically come over. They open Recents and Messages and see everything reconstructed within a minute — no manual export needed.' },

    highlight: 'Critical reliability fixes',
    changes: [
      { type: 'fixed', text: 'Incoming calls were going straight to voicemail when the dialer wasn\'t the front window — even though your computer was awake. Calls now ring reliably whether the app is in front, minimized, or in your system tray.' },
      { type: 'fixed', text: 'The incoming call screen sometimes showed the wrong line name (for example, "Main" when someone actually called your "Office Line"). Now correctly shows which of your lines was dialed.' },
